=over

=item LOG4SH_DATE=1

Date/timestamp before each message ( to STDOUT and a log file )

=item LOG4SH_DATE_LOG=1

Print date/timestamp only to a log file

=item LOG4SH_DATE_FORMAT="+%F-%T"

Default format for a timestamp. Same as format for L<date(1)>.

=item LOG4SH_DATE_BIN=''

Absolute path to GNU date. If you use this library on AIX machine you should define absolute path to the GNU date program.

The library checks: path /opt/freeware/bin/date for existing  and date for default PATH. The GNU date supports I<--version> switch.

=item LOG4SH_FORMAT=''

A format for the header of each message. It could overwrite the default format: 'timestamp [log level]'

=item LOG4SH_COLOR=1

Does it use colors? There are following default colors:

    * ERROR   - red
    * FATAL   - red
    * INFO    - white
    * SUCCESS - green
    * WARN    - yellow
    * DEBUG   - blue
    * TRACE   - cyan

There are following defined colors:

    * LOG4SH_DEFAULT_COLOR
    * LOG4SH_ERROR_COLOR
    * LOG4SH_FATAL_COLOR
    * LOG4SH_INFO_COLOR
    * LOG4SH_SUCCESS_COLOR
    * LOG4SH_WARN_COLOR
    * LOG4SH_DEBUG_COLOR
    * LOG4SH_TRACE_COLOR

You can also overwrite them.
